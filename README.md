## Google Colab Notebooks
- **Gst_Analytics_hackathon.ipynb**: This notebook serves as the main code file, encompassing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes. It provides the foundational logic for the entire project.
- **Model and hyperparameter compare.ipynb**: This notebook is dedicated to comparing various machine learning models and their hyperparameters, showcasing their performance through visualizations and metrics.

## Model Evaluation
The models included in this project have been evaluated using several key performance metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the predictions.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the actual positive cases.
- **F1 Score**: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
- **AUC-ROC**: This metric indicates how well the model can distinguish between classes.

## Data
The datasets utilized for training and testing are stored in the respective directories, ensuring proper organization and accessibility for analysis.
